# lane-and-curve-detection
Lane and curve detection using OpenCV involves processing images or video frames to identify road lanes and curves, primarily for autonomous driving or driver-assistance systems. The process typically follows these steps:

Preprocessing: Convert the image to grayscale, apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise, and use edge detection (e.g., Canny Edge Detector) to highlight lane boundaries.

Region of Interest (ROI) Selection: Mask out unnecessary parts of the image to focus only on the road.

Line Detection: Use the Hough Transform to detect straight lane lines or polynomial fitting for curved lanes.

Perspective Transformation (Optional): Apply a "bird’s-eye view" transformation for better lane detection.

Lane Overlay & Visualization: Draw detected lanes onto the original image for visualization.
